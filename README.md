# PowerShellGeek (Microsoft MVP Damian Scoles)
With the deprecation of Microsoft's Technet Gallery my scripts needed a new home.  In addition to this, I have a blog where I post a lot of code / scripts that do not live anywhere else and wanted to provide that code a public facing site as well.  The intent and purpose of this repository is to hold both these code sets allowing for a one stop shop for my larger code projects, smaller code projects and future code projects.  Initially these scripts will not be up for contributors as I am the sole creator of the code and want to beheld responsible for these projects.

## What can you expect to see here?
